<!--Your task is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This project focuses mostly on HTML, CSS and layouts with CSS.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete this project. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Download the starter code and go through the README.md file.
This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.html file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc. Don't forget to share your submissions with the community to get feedback.
